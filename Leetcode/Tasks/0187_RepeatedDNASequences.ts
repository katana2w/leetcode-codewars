/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/description/
 *
 * The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
 *
 * For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
 * When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 *
 * Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
 * Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
 * Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 105
 * s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.
